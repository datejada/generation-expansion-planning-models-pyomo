# Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) models considering uncertainties on renewable energy resources (RES) using python/pyomo

The following files solve the GEP problem for three scenarios of wind and solar production using different approaches:

* **Stochastic-GEP.py**: Two-Stage Stochastic Generation Expansion Planning

The models are developed in [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) and solved using [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/).

The main references to model the optimization problems are:
